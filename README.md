# Tamizhan Skills YouTube Intro/Outro Template

## Project Overview

This project delivers a professional, branded intro and outro video template for Tamizhan Skills (TS). The templates will be designed for a 5–10 second duration each, featuring TS’s logo, tagline, custom animation, and background music.

These assets will provide a cohesive brand identity for all TS YouTube channels and promotional videos, ensuring a consistent and engaging viewer experience.

## Problem Statement

Tamizhan Skills currently lacks a unified, branded video identity across its digital platforms. As a result, viewers may not immediately associate educational content with TS, leading to reduced brand recall and engagement.

---

## Objectives

- **Design a 5–10 second intro** that highlights the Tamizhan Skills logo and tagline.
- **Design a 5–10 second outro** with space for social media handles or a clear call-to-action (CTA).
- Incorporate smooth animations, professional transitions, and background music.
- Provide editable project files for easy integration into existing and future videos.

   - Tagline text: “Empowering Students. Shaping Futures”
